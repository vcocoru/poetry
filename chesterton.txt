If I had been a heathen, I'd have praised the purple vine
My slaves should dig the vineyard, and I would drink the wine
But Higgins is a heathen, and his slaves grow lean and gray
That he should drink some tepid milk exactly twice a day

If I had been a heathen, I'd have praised Neara's Curls
And filled my life with love affairs, my house with dancing girls
But Higgins is a heathen, and to lecture rooms is forced
Where his aunts, who are not married, demand to be divorced!

Haveth no cheese

You might as well add some colour to the default text editor.
The peoms look better in pink :)
